# Car-Black-Box
The Car Black Box project logs car data, including speed, timestamp, and gear position, using a PIC18F4580 microcontroller. It features functions to download, save, and view logs, as well as change the system's password and update the system time. Implementation involves embedded C and interfacing with external storage and I/O devices.
