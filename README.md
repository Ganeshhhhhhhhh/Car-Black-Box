# Car-Black-Box
The Car Black Box project records various data logs from a car, including speed, timestamp, and gear position, similar to an airplane's black box. This system runs on a PIC18F4580 microcontroller and includes functionality to download logs, save logs, view logs, change the system's password, and update the system time. The implementation involves using embedded C and interfacing with external storage and input/output devices.
